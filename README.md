# Node.js coding challenge

We are looking for people who can build great software, so we created this challenge to test your skills.

## Brief
Lex users want to report to moderators posts that are inappropriate. The moderators want to be more efficient in resolving these reports. We decided to build a software that can automate their processes â€” the software that you're going to develop. 

Your task is to provide APIs for a frontend application that satisfies all [Product requirements](#product-requirements) described below.

> **This is important.** We hope you can spend about 4 hours on this project. If you can finish faster - great! If not, limit yourself and don't spend much longer than 4 hours.

### Product requirements
- Users can report an inappropriate post.
- New reports should be automatically assigned to any free moderator.  
- A moderator can only handle one report at a time. 
- When a moderator reviews a post, the report is marked as resolved and the responsible moderator becomes available to take a new report. 
- The system should be able to assign unassigned reports automatically when a moderator becomes available.

### Tech requirements
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- You are free to use any database or framework, but please explain your choice.
- Tests - focus on coverage that in your opinion makes the most sense.

### Additional info
- Please stick to the product requirements. You should not implement authorisation and authentication, as they are not important for the assessment. Assume everyone can make requests to any API. 
- We value quality over feature-completeness. The goal of this code sample is to help us identify what you consider production-ready code. You should consider this code ready for final review with your colleague!

## How to submit
Create a private repository on GitHub and invite [@junebugfix](https://github.com/junebugfix) to it.

Optionally, send us a link to a deployed version on Heroku or any other service that will expose that API for testing.
